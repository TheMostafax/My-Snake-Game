<h1 align="center">Notes</h1>
<h4 align="left">1. I am still working on some new features, this is just phase one.</h4>
<h4 align="left">2. There are some spelling mistakes in the demo due to fast typing, but I fixed them in the code. </h4>
<h4 align="left">3. I didn't upload my artworks images in the assets folder to avoid any problem.</h4>
